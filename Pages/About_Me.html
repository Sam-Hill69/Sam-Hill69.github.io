            <p>Thank you for visiting my webpage. My goal is to create a community 
                where people can ask questions and not feel shamed or belittled. 
                This community is for anyone who has a growth mindset and genuinely 
                wants to be a better human being. This is a space online where people
                can meet local people with the same goals and visions and they can
                work together to accomplish anything they can dream of. You can 
                achieve anything you put your mind to. Anything you can dream and 
                really want deep down the universe will provide. One of my weaknesses 
                is I struggle to follow through with projects and ideas. I have 
                started countless projects throughout my life. To solve this I have 
                decided to give myself rewards as I complete them. I am going to 
                force myself to see projects through until the end. I need you guys 
                to hold me accountable and I will do the same to each member of this 
                community because I genuinely want to see you succeed and live the 
                best life you want and deserve.</p>
