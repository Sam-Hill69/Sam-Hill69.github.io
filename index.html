            <p>Thank you for visiting my webpage. My goal is to create a community 
                where people can ask questions and not feel shamed or belittled. 
                This community is for anyone who has a growth mindset and genuienly 
                wants to be a better human being. This is a space online where people
            can meet local people with the same goals and visions and they can
            work together to accomplish anything they can dream of. You can 
            achieve anything you put your mind to. Anything you can dream and 
            really want deep down the universe will provide. One of my weaknesses 
            is I struggle to follow through with projects and ideas. I have 
            started countless projects throughout my life. To solve this I have 
            decided to give meself rewards as I complete them,
            I am going to force myself to see projects through until the 
                end. I need you guys to hold me accountable and I will do the same to 
                each member of this community because I genuily want to see you 
                succeed and live the best life you want and deserve. </p>
