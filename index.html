        <p>Thank you for visiting my webpage. My goal is to create a community 
            where people can ask questions and not feel shamed or belittled. 
            This community is for anyone who has a growth mindset and genuienly 
            wants to be a better human being. 
            This is a space online where people can meet local people with the 
            same goals and visions and they can work together to accomplish 
            anything they can dream of. 
            You can achieve anything you put your mind to. Anything you can 
            dream and really want deep down the universe will provide. 
            One of my weaknesses is I struggle to follow through with projects 
            and ideas. I have started countless projects throughout my life. 
            To solve this I have decided to give meself rewards as I complete 
            them, I am going to force myself to see projects through until the 
            end. 
            I need you guys to hold me accountable and I will do the same to 
            each member of this community because I genuily want to see you 
            succeed and live the best life you want and deserve. </p>
